Twitter bot

# Description
Just a project to practice JavaScript using Node.js and [Twit API](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) developed by @[ttezel](https://github.com/ttezel).

# Details
I made this bot following the steps taught by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) on his [series of videos about twitter bots](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6byiVX7_Z1rclitVhMBmNFQ) and all changes I've made were trying to make easier to see our results on the terminal.
